# Aklatan

A Library Management program using Qt and C++.

## Objective of the Aklatan Project
The original Library Management System Project (LMS) came from our college thesis written in VB and used Microsoft Access as it's database backend.
It tracks books and users using RFID tags and barcodes. This project aims to rewrite most of the original LMS program for cross-platform support for Windows and Linux. And this time it's going to be open-source. 


### Specific Objectives
*   Rewrite the program with the Qt libraries and frameworks.
*   Compatibility with the hardware used in the original LMS project.
    * Obtain information given by the RFID reader running on an Arduino Uno.
*   Separate programs for Users and the Library Admins.
*   Change the database backend to SQLite.
*   Make it easier to setup for multiple computers.

## Contribute
If you would like to contribute, please go to the [Github repo](https://github.com/AJigsawnHalo/aklatan) and open an [issue](https://github.com/AJigsawnHalo/Aklatan/issues) or submit a [pull request](https://github.com/AJigsawnHalo/Aklatan/pulls).
I'm a begginer at both Qt and C++ and I'm still learning so the code might be a bit inefficient and messy some times. 

### Things I'm working on.
*   Main Library window.
    * Issue, Return, Book Report, and Add User/Book Pages

### Things to be done in the future
*   User-facing Windows
    * Login Window
    * Search Window
*   Original LMS hardware support
